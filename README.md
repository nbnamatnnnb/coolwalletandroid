## CoolWallet Design

CoolWallet is a hardware cryptocurrency wallet designed with security and convenience in mind. Here are some key features:

- **Slim and Portable**: CoolWallet is credit card-sized and fits easily into your wallet, making it convenient to carry with you wherever you go.

- **Secure Element Chip**: Utilizes a secure element chip to store private keys and conduct cryptographic operations in a secure environment, protecting your assets from potential threats.

- **Bluetooth Connectivity**: Connects to your smartphone via Bluetooth, allowing you to manage your cryptocurrency assets with ease through the CoolBitX mobile app.

- **Mnemonic Seed Backup**: During setup, CoolWallet generates a mnemonic seed that serves as a backup for recovering access to your funds. This seed follows the BIP39 standard and can be used with compatible wallets.

- **Biometric Authentication**: Supports biometric authentication (fingerprint or face recognition) for an added layer of security when accessing your wallet.

- **Multi-Currency Support**: Supports a wide range of cryptocurrencies, allowing you to store and manage multiple assets in one wallet.
